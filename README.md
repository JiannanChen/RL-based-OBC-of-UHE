# RL-based-OBC-of-UHE
This code is the solution for the flatness of the excavator.
The expected values of each joint Angle and the hydraulic cylinder can be solved from the flatness trajectory.
The specific ADP control algorithm can be referred toï¼šhttps://github.com/JiannanChen/RL-basedOBC-of-UFFR.git
